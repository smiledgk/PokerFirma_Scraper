I was faced with a problem that whenever I go to casino and encounter the unknown person, I do not have an idea of his way of playing poker. 

Since, the local casino does not have an official open-source database but posts daily tournament results online, 
i scraped through the website news data from 2017 to 2024 and created a database of news, and, therefore, extracted the players, their total nubmer of cashes and winnings.

The project is done with Beautiful Soup extension. For CSV integration and analysis of data i ussed pandas library.

I cleaned the data and represented it in a way, that it would be easy to check any name of each player. 

Moreover, I created two lists of players, sorted by their number of cashes and their total winnings.

SQL is not used in this project, only CSV data.
